# Project 1

Due end of day on Sunday June 19th.

The goal of this assignment is to help you build your intuition about recommender systems, with a basic soup to nuts implementation coded “from scratch.”

Your task is to build a very basic recommender system, first by writing your own functions, then by replacing those functions with those provided in an R Package or a Python library (such as scikit-learn).

* You should very briefly first describe the recommender system that you’re going to build out from a business perspective, e.g. “This system recommends movies to users.”
* You can find a dataset, or build out your own toy dataset and load into (for example) an R or pandas dataframe, a Python dictionary or list of lists, (or other data structure of your choosing).
* You can use either collaborative filtering, or a hybrid of content management and collaborative filtering.
* You are encouraged to hand code at least your similarity function.
* After you have built out your own code base, create an alternate version using packages or libraries.  Compare the results and performance.
* You are also encouraged to think about how to best handle missing data.
* Your code should be turned in an RMarkdown file or a Jupyter notebook, and posted to Github.
