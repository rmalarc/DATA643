    "The goal of this assignment is for you to try out different ways of implementing and configuring a recommender, and to evaluate your different approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "For project 2, you’re asked to take some recommendation data (such as your toy movie dataset, Movielens, or another Dataset of your choosing), and implement at least two different recommendation algorithms on the data.  For example, content-based, user-user CF, and/or item-item CF.  You should evaluate different approaches, using different algorithms, normalization techniques, similarity methods, neighborhood sizes, etc.  You don’t need to be exhaustive—these are just some suggested possibilities.  You may use whatever third party libraries you want.  Please provide at least one graph, and a textual summary of your evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may work in a small group.  Please submit a link to your GitHub repository for your Jupyter notebook or RMarkdown file.  Due end of day on Sunday June 26th.\n",

    "  * I couldn't get it to reference other RDDs within another's functor. For instnace, I had to hardcode the length of the recipe's array as I couldn't directly access it within the second iterator. Due to the same reason, I had to first calculate whatever I wanted to access from within the functor, and bake it into the RDD by using joins. Perhaps this is the Spark way.

    "  * I couldn't get the Column Simmilarities method to function properly with a matrix of sparse vectors. Due to time constrains, I turned into a dense vector (not pretty)\n",
    "* It was really cool to be able to completely parse a plain text list of recipes into a \"dataset\".\n",
    "* The cosine simmilarity seems to work pretty nicely, even in a really sparse scenario such as this one. Better results should be obtained by mastering the list of ingredients."
